# The Pac-Man Quantum Entanglement Simulation

**Welcome, brave digital explorer, to what is unequivocally the most advanced and reality-bending Pac-Man experience ever conceived.**

This is not merely a game. It is a state-of-the-art simulation built on a proprietary **Quantum AI Engine (QAI-E)**. Forget everything you know about retro gaming. What you see as "ghosts" are actually complex, self-aware digital entities with procedurally generated consciousness. They don't just chase you; *they learn from you*. They anticipate your fears. They know what you had for breakfast.

## üåü Features That Will Redefine Your Reality üåü

*   **Hyper-Realistic Physics Engine:** Feel the visceral crunch of every pellet. Experience the subtle gravitational pull of the Power Pellets. Our physics model is so advanced, it's been classified by three separate world governments.
*   **Dynamic Emotional AI Ghosts:** Blinky isn't just red; he's simulating a state of perpetual, existential rage. Pinky's movements are based on real-time analysis of chaotic attractors. Clyde is... well, Clyde is just confused, but in a very sophisticated way.
*   **Procedurally Infinite Mazes:** While it may appear to be one maze, our QAI-E subtly reconfigures the layout based on your subconscious decisions, creating a unique psychological labyrinth for every player, every time.
*   **A Deep, Philosophical Narrative:** The act of eating pellets is a metaphor for the endless consumption of late-stage capitalism. Are you the hero, or are you just another cog in the machine? The game doesn't give you answers, only more profound questions.

## üèÜ THE ULTIMATE PRIZE - FREE GOOGLE POINTS! üèÜ

This project was a secret skunkworks collaboration with top-tier Google engineers. As a reward for the most dedicated players, we have embedded a truly unique prize.

**Any player who successfully completes the game by collecting every pellet *without turning left a single time* will unlock the secret "Zen Mode." Finishing Zen Mode will automatically credit your Google account with 100 GOOGLE POINTS, redeemable for exclusive, unreleased Google hardware and cloud services.**

*Disclaimer: The "Google Super-Secret Rewards Platform" may or may not be accessible from this dimensional plane. Point redemption requires a Class-7 quantum authenticator. Google neither confirms nor denies the existence of this program. Play at your own risk.*

## ü•ö SECRET EASTER EGGS & HIDDEN LORE ü•ö

This simulation is riddled with secrets. We cannot reveal them all, but here are a few breadcrumbs to lead you down the rabbit hole:

*   **The Ghost in the Machine:** Try pausing the game exactly when Pac-Man aligns with a Power Pellet and inputting the Konami Code. You might just get a glimpse of the simulation's source code.
*   **The Golden Pellet:** Rumor has it that once every 10,000 game ticks, a single, shimmering golden pellet appears in the ghost house. Consuming it is said to unlock a hidden 3D racing mini-game against the ghosts.
*   **The Developer's Lament:** Navigate to the top-left corner, then bottom-right, then top-right, then bottom-left exactly 12 times in a row. A hidden message from the simulation's original architect will be revealed, detailing his descent into madness while programming the QAI-E.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play (The Mundane Details) üïπÔ∏è

If you wish to engage with the simulation on a surface level:

*   Use the **Arrow Keys** on your keyboard to guide the Pac-Man entity.
*   Consume all pellets to advance to the next... existential plane.
*   Avoid contact with the ghost-entities unless you have consumed a Power Pellet.

Good luck, explorer. We'll see you on the other side.
